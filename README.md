Wolff is a ridiculously small and lightweight PHP framework.

It is intended for those who want to build lightweight websites without starting from scratch or dealing with large frameworks.

Wolff is small, fast, scalable and easy. The perfect solution for building small and medium-sized web applications.

## Features

* **Extremely easy**: It's quite simple to use and has a clean documentation. It gives you the opportunity to learn it in just one night (sleep included).

* **Ridiculously fast**: If a resource is not used, it's not loaded. Even some of the elements of the framework can be disabled. Wolff is friendly with potato servers.

* **Comprenhensive**: Wolff elements cover everything you may need for building a web app. No initial setup is required, they are safe and ready to be used.
